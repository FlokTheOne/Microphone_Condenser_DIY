-- I made this microphone using a TL072 preamplifier. the entire thing is powered by a 9V battery and the circuit is ready to be directly connected to your PC.

 sorry the mic is not sensitive enough to catch sound more than 1 inch away tho. its work-in-progress til i nail it or give up

## Components:
- 1x Electret Condenser microphone
- 1x TL072 Operation Amplifier
- 1x Audio jack 3.5mm 
- few capacitor and resistors
