# Microphone_Condenser_DIY
A DIY electret condenser microphone I made using a TL072 operational amplifier and a few passive components, all connected to the mic jack of a PC

the project file name is "Stoned" if you havent noticed.

KiCanvas link if you want to check the circuit but dont have KiCad installed: https://kicanvas.org/?github=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFlokTheOne%2FMicrophone_Condenser_DIY

Dear reviewer, i wont link this readme as the demo cuz people dont vote for boring projects or anything that requires work. People wanna see a video with one mouse click and no one actually reads the READMEs except reviewers. So it will be appreciated if you just accept it as it is. i did everything else as you wanted. I linked demo and kicanvas here and it should be okay now. But as i said before, people want one-click demos. boring readmes will only guarantee me 0/10 votes




-- I made this microphone using a TL072 preamplifier. the entire thing is powered by a 9V battery and the circuit is ready to be directly connected to your PC.

 sorry the mic is not sensitive enough to catch sound more than 1 inch away tho. its work-in-progress til i nail it or give up

## Components:
- 1x Electret Condenser microphone
- 1x TL072 Operation Amplifier
- 1x Audio jack 3.5mm (duh!)
- few_x capacitor and resistors
